# Introduction


A short-term impact of forest clearcutting is an increase in stream temperatures. While this increased temperature can negatively impact many riparian species, Pacific giant salamander populations are relatively resilient to these short-term changes (Bury and Corn, 1988). However, Bury and Corn (1988) find that Pacific giant salamander 

Murphy and Hall (1981) found that biomass of Pacific giant salamander in clearcut and old growth forest is not significantly different, but that changes in biomass across stream section is significantly correlated with changes in gradient. While the abundance of Pacifc giant salamanders can be higher in recently clear-cut areas due to temporary increases in prodctivity, these populations will stabilize between 10 and 20 years after logging (Murphy and Hall, 1981). 

Thus, in Mack Creek, we would predict that Pacific giant salamander population abundance in old growth forest stands and forest that has been clearcut over 20 years ago would not be significantly different, and that the location in a stream (cascade, pool or side channel) would impact relative abundance.

# Data and Methods

Data for Pacific giant salamander counts and weight in Mack Creek (Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon) was gathered by the Andrews Forest LTER Site. Data gathering for West Slope cutthroat trout (*Onchorhyncus clarki clarki*) began in 1987, while data have been gathered for Pacific giant salamander since 1993. Data is gathered in two reaches of Mack Creek: one being a section of clearcut forest (cleared in 1963) and a section of 500-year old old growth forest.

In this report, Pacific giant salamander counts and weight are compared against the section of stream (clear cut or old growth) where salamanders were observed, as well as the type of stream channel (cascade, pool or side channel.) Counts and proportions of salamanders in 2017 by stream section were compared to counts and proportions by channel type using a chi-squared test ($\alpha$ = 0.05). Mean weight of salamanders was compared by channel type using a one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey's HSD test ($\alpha$ = 0.05).

Analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

***Figure 3.*** Annual counts of Pacific giant salamanders observed in the old growth and clear cut section of Mack Creek, 1993 - 2017. While salamander counts in old growth sections have generally been slightly greater over time, trends in populations in both sections appear to be similar. Salamander counts in the clear cut section were greater than counts in the old growth section beginning in 2015. 

### Results B: Counts and Proportions of Pacific Giant Salamanders in 2017

As noted above, the count of salamanders in both the old growth and clear sections has increased over time. Yet this total count includes observations of salamanders in cascades, pools and side channels within these two sections.

  select(-channel_type)

chi_test <- chisq.test(chi_counts)

```

### Results C: Salamanders in Stream Section Versus Location Within Stream 

In 2017, the location of Pacific giant salamanders in the channel varied slightly based on the section of stream. Pacific giant salamanders are found slightly more in cascades in clear cut forests (n = `r channel_count_table$CC[1]`, 55.1% ) than in old growth forests (n = `r channel_count_table$OG[1]`, 44.9%), slightly less in pools in clear cut forests (n = `r channel_count_table$CC[2]`, 40.8%) than in old growth forests (n = `r channel_count_table$OG[2]`, 59.2%), and more in side channels in clear cut forests (n = `r channel_count_table$CC[3]`, 54.9%) than in old growth forests (n = `r channel_count_table$OG[3]`, 45.1%). However, there is a not significant effect of the section of stream on where Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side chnnel) by a Chi-square test ($\chi$^2^(`r chi_test$parameter`) = `r round(chi_test$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round(chi_test$p.value, 2)`).

    var_weight = var(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_weight = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE))

# Means very different from medians. Seems like outliers having a large effect on means. 

# Check variances 

levene <- leveneTest(weight~ channel_type, data = salamander_channel_type)
tidy(levene)

```

Mean salamander weight observed in old growth sections (`r round(weight_ttest$estimate[1],2)` g) and clear cut sections (`r round(weight_ttest$estimate[2],2)` g) is also not significantly different (t(`r round(weight_ttest$parameter,2)`) = `r round(weight_ttest$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round (weight_ttest$p.value,2)`).

# Results E 

# Second, answer: Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in pools vs. cascades vs. side-channels in 2017? 

# Run a one way ANOVA

weight_aov <- aov(weight ~ channel_type, data = salamander_channel_type)
summary(weight_aov)

# At least one different 

# Tukey Post-Hoc

weight_post_hoc <- TukeyHSD(weight_aov)
weight_post_hoc

# Weight only different in side channel & pools. Pools/cascades and side channel/pools not significantly different. 

aov_outputs <- unlist(summary(weight_aov))

# The first item [1] is the numerator degrees of freedom; 
# The second item [2] is the denominator degrees of freedom; 
# The seventh item [7] is the F-statistic value;
# The ninth item [9] is the p-value

```

Mean weight (g) of Pacific giant salamanders observed in side channels differed significantly from the mean weight of salamanders observed in pools (one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD, F(`r aov_outputs[1]`, `r aov_outputs[2]`) = `r round(aov_outputs[7],2)`, *p* = `r round(aov_outputs[9],3)` ). There were no statistical differences between all other pairings. Mean weight of salamanders observed in pools (`r round(salamander_weight_summary$mean_weight[2],2)` g) is `r round(((salamander_weight_summary$mean_weight[2] - salamander_weight_summary$mean_weight[3]) / salamander_weight_summary$mean_weight[3]) * 100, 2)`% greater than the mean weight of salamanders found in side channels (`r round(salamander_weight_summary$mean_weight[3],2)` g). 

While comparing the mean weight of Pacific giant salamander is useful, there are some reasons why medians may be a more useful measure of comparison. For one, the data have a heavy positive skew and are potentially non-normal. Outliers may also be heavily influencing the mean. For example, the mean weight of salamders found in pools is `r round(salamander_weight_summary$mean_weight[2],2)` g, while the median weight is `r round(salamander_weight_summary$median_weight[2],2)` g. A Levene's test indicates that the variances are equal, and ANOVAs are relatively resilient to violations of normality, so comparing means is not necessarily wrong in this situation. However, given this non-normal data, a non-parametric rank based test that compares medians (such as Kruskal-Wallis) may be more approprirate for use.

# Summary

 - Pacifc giant salamander populations in both clear cut and old growth forests have increased since data gathering began in 1993. This matches observations from Murphy and Hall (1981) indicating that clear cut and old growth forest sections have limited impact on relative salamander abundance, especially after 10-20 years since logging. 
- There is no statistical effect of stream section (clear cut or old growth) on where salamanders are found (pool, cascade or side channel), and salamander weight was not significantly different between stream sections. 
- Mean weight of salamanders found in pools was signifcantly greater than mean weight of salamanders found in side channels. However, there was no statistical difference in mean weight of salamanders in pools and cascades, and cascades and side channels.
